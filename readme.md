# Just Wanna Compare Practically

## 📌 Description
As a fan of PHP and Laravel for the backend, I want to **practically compare** what my colleagues say about the speed and performance of different backend technologies. I'll also explore the reasons why each of them finds their current stack convenient.

## 🛠️ Aim and Objectives
1. Learn **Node.js** with **Express** as the backend.
2. Create a **CRUD** application using the new tech stack.
3. While familiarizing myself with the new environment, I will **analyze and compare** both technologies.

## 🚀 Development
```bash
npm run vb
---
```

## 🚀 Production
```bash
npm run kb
```
